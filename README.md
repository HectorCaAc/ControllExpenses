4. [ ] The borders of different elements of the dashboard do not show a current event.s
5. [ ] Create an element for the entries, to be able to display in a good way.
6. [ ] For the Summary page, be sure that the containers have less space for the borders and less space between them 
7. [ ] For now if the user is log in into the project, the user can log in again wtf
8. [ ] To if exists a lot of entries or at the moment of query those it will be a good idead to use the overflow 
9. [ ] Add test for the models (I have the feeling that the Income and the functionality to enter new income is not workig)
