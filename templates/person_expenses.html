    <h3>This is a really simple web application at the moment</h3>
    <p>But with hard work and time it can get me a nice job </p>
    <p>if I applie myself and also if I make it look nice</p>

    <h3>Things to do </h3>
    <ul>

      <li>Be able to organize by categories and expenses</li>
      <li>show the current 10 but be able to display more</li>
      <li>make sure that values inside of price can only be positive(back end or front end)</li>
      <li>It is required to add some script that will allow me to create dummy data</li>
      <li>For now the user and the categories are all mixed, but in the future it will be just the user</li>
